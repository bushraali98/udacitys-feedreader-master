# Feed Reader Testing

This project satisfies the requirements of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree Project #4. It is basically like an RSS Feed application, and the project is designed to make sure various functions and aspects of the application work and behave as expected.


# How to run the project

Locate the index.html file, and open it using an HTML5 browser, such as Chrome or Firefox.

# How can I tell if the test worked or not?
